# How to Query Your Data

Axio Hub uses **Hybrid Search** (Keyword + Semantic) to find answers. This means you don't need to match exact keywords.

## Tips for Better Results
* **Be Specific:** Instead of "What about the project?", ask "What is the budget for the Alpha Project in Q3?".
* **Ask for Summaries:** "Summarize the key risks mentioned in the compliance document."
* **Follow Up:** You can ask follow-up questions like "Who is responsible for that risk?"
